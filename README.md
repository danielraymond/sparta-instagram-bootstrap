# Instragram Homepage Homework

The page I have produced is very similar to the actual instagram homepage. A few of the styling options could be tweaked however I am happy with the current state of the page.

The main problem with the homework is the response of the page to screen size changes. At mobile screen sizes the page is good however as the page scales down some of the elements overlap each other.
